Title: Peloton's Turnaround Is Happening

Test: Peloton's Turnaround Is HappeningPeloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON) shares soared 35% on Thursday as the exercise equipment company showed it finally restored its sales growth for the first time in nine quarters. While Peloton delivered a mixed full year outlook, its quarterly results were well ahead of Wall Street estimates.Fourth Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter ended on June 30th, Peloton grew its revenue about 0.2% YoY to $643.6 million, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $631 million. Although this is a slight increase of $1.5 million, Peloton managed to return to revenue growth during a typically slower quarter as summer is all about traveling and going out. Peloton was not able to achieve sales growth since 2021’s holiday quarter and this is typically its strongest season so the latest success is to be applauded. Although Peloton’s pricy connected fitness hardware continued to decline as it reported a sales drop of about 4%, subscription revenue increased 2.3%, with the segment’s gross margin also rising by 1 percentage point. To combat declining hardware sales, Peloton found a way to grow its subscription revenue through the secondary market, with revenue from this segment growing 16% YoY.More importantly, Peloton significantly narrowed down its losses to $30.5 million, which is quite an improvement from the $241.1 million loss it reported during last year’s comparable quarter. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $70 million which easily surpassed StreetAccount’s $53 million estimate. Unlike last year’s comparable quarter with negative $74 million in free cash flow and previous quarter with also a negative $8 million, this time round, Peloton generated $26 million in free cash flow. Peloton pulled it off by lowering its sales and marketing spending by $25.5 million or 19% YoY and it will continue to make such budget reductions through the current fiscal year.GuidanceFor the current quarter, Peloton guided for sales between $560 million and $580 million, which is lower compared to LSEG’s estimate of $609 million. However, Peloton guided for stronger EBITDA compared to StreetAccount’s estimate of $45 million as its outlook is in the range from $50 million to $60 million.As for the full year, Peloton guided for sales in the range between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, which is lower than LSEG’s estimate of $2.7 billion.The connected bike and treat maker company is doing its homework.The connected fitness company has been working on improving its balance sheet by lowering its sales and marketing spending, shifting its growth focus towards profitability. The latest results show that Peloton is doing a good job at digging itself out of the red. The restructuring plan that Peloton announced earlier this year seems to be working. As part of its turnaround, Peloton is trimming 15% of its workforce to bring annualized cost savings of $200 million in by the end of fiscal 2025 and its financials are already benefiting from these cost-cutting measures. Going ahead, Peloton remains focused on improving the user experience, but the effects of subscriber growth are to be seen over the long haul and therefore, are not expected during the current fiscal year.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Title: Peloton’s former billionaire CEO says he’s lost all his money and had to sell his possessions

Test: Peloton was one of the hottest commodities on the market during the pandemic. But as the dangers of COVID-19 subsided, so too did the stock of the fitness equipment company, and its former billionaire CEO John Foley says his wealth got wiped out in the process."You know, at one point I had a lot of money on paper," Foley, who cofounded Peloton in 2012 and was at its helm for a decade, told the New York Post."Not actually [in the bank], unfortunately. I've lost all my money. I've had to sell almost everything in my life."When demand for at-home workouts surged during the early days of COVID-19, Peloton sales soared by 250%, stock rose by more than 400%, and Foley became a billionaire seemingly overnight.But the company overestimated demand as pandemic restrictions lifted and people started exercising outside again.By November 2021, Peloton stock had plummeted, and Foley had lost his newly minted 10-figure status.Then, in December 2021, the premiere episode of the Sex and the City reboot, And Just Like That…, killed off one of its main characters, Mr. Big, who suffered a heart attack…while riding a Peloton.“We were coming out of Covid. The stock was getting crushed. And then the Mr. Big thing happens…it was brutal,” he recalled. “All of a sudden, we were just being trolled…everything was collapsing.”Once worth a staggering $50 billion, the New York–based company was only just holding on to its unicorn status when Foley stepped down as CEO in February 2022. Foley was once worth $1.9 billion, according to Bloomberg, but left the company with a net worth of $225 million.The company has since cycled through another CEO, Barry McCarthy, laid off thousands of employees, hiked prices, and announced the closure of retail stores to tackle its post-pandemic slump in demand.Its market cap is still a shadow of what it once was, currently standing at $1.8 billion.Fortune has reached out to Foley for comment.Peloton’s stock bloodbath killed more than Foley’s billionaire statusIt’s not just Foley’s billionaire status (and a career at the company he created) that was killed by Peloton's stock price bloodbath.The ex-Peloton chief was forced to downsize twice—including selling a $55 million East Hampton waterfront home and uprooting his family."My family took it well," the 53-year-old told the New York Post. "My wife's super supportive. My kids are probably better for it, if we're keeping it real."Though Foley has lost much of his fortune, the ordeal has not extinguished his ambition.Story continuesWithin a year of resigning from the top job at Peloton, he had raised $25 million for his new venture, a direct-to-consumer rug company called Ernesta.Now, he believes the company can make as much as $500 million in free cash flow by 2030."I'm working hard so that I can try to make money again…because I don't have much left," Foley concluded. "And so I'm hungry and humble."‘None of it’s real’As Foley’s experience illustrates, reaching billionaire status can be pretty meaningless if that wealth is on paper and tied up in stock that can't easily be sold.After being named Britain’s youngest billionaire, Gymshark founder and CEO Ben Francis said that “none of it is real,” adding that his wealth is “all on paper” and tied to assets that could fluctuate in value.“It could double, it could [halve],” the millennial entrepreneur added. “That’s why I think it’s important that no individual should ever pin their self-worth on things like wealth, net worth, or anything financial.”It’s why defining your success by your net worth is “a wildly unproductive way to live” in his eyes.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comView comments
