Test: A bounce-back quarter for Salesforce (CRM).Shares of the SaaS company popped 4% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as it bested Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins, and earnings.The reaction — and tone around the quarter's performance — is in stark contrast to just three months ago, when the company shockingly missed sales estimates for the first time since 2006.Demand remains strong, and there are "big goals" for operating margins and cash flow, Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me on Yahoo Finance.Sales increased 11% in Europe and 16% in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. The company's Americas segment notched 8% sales growth."I don't think anyone expected a repeat performance of that [last quarter]," Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance. Added Miner, "What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin. Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history."The company maintained its full year sales outlook, but lifted its expectations for operating margins. That may spur enthusiasm that Salesforce's various AI initiatives will boost profits.To that end, Benioff teased the coming launch of AgentForce, which features AI sales agents that go beyond chatbots and can resolve customer inquiries. Benioff says more details will be shared in September at the company's closely watched Dreamforce conference.But he tells me the service is a higher margin opportunity and will be priced by conversation. Benioff envisions one billion agents in service by the end of fiscal year 2026.He also says Microsoft has "misled" customers "that they have to do so much heavy lifting on the technology side." Salesforce aims to enable customers to train their models within its platform."They get real value from AI now," he says of Salesforce's offerings."One of the biggest initiatives in the field is around monetizing the AI theme within the Salesforce massive installed base. We believe this is a major land grab opportunity that could significantly benefit Salesforce over the coming years and could increase overall revenue by $4 billion+ annually based on our estimates and field work by 2025," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a client note.The earnings rundownNet Sales: $9.33 billion (+8% year over year) vs. $9.23 billion estimate (guidance: $9.2 billion to $9.25 billionCurrent Remaining Performance Obligations: $26.5 billion vs. $26.31 billionAdjusted Operating Margin: 33.7% vs. 31.94% estimateDiluted EPS: $2.56 (+21% year over year) vs. $2.35 estimateStory continuesWhat else caught our attention: the outlookFull-Year Sales Guidance: $37.7 billion to $38 billion vs. $37.84 billion estimate (prior guidance: $37.7 billion to $38 billion)Full-Year Operating Margin Guidance: 32.8% vs 32.52% estimate (prior guidance: 32.5%)Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

Title: Is Apple Siri the Best AI Assistant in 2024?

Test: We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Siri stands against the other AI assistants.As we have mentioned in our article, “10 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $1," the estimated value of the global artificial intelligence market in 2023 was $196.63 billion, and between 2024 and 2030, it is expected to increase at a CAGR of 36.6%.Regionally, in terms of revenue, the North American AI market held a 30.9% share in 2023, while from 2024 to 2030, the artificial intelligence industry in Europe is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 33.2%, per Grand View Research. Moreover, the artificial intelligence and robotics markets in the United States have advanced significantly, with an estimated valuation of $42.00 billion in 2023.The U.S. Census Bureau survey indicates that industry-specific AI adoption rates differ. The information and professional, scientific, and technical services sectors dominate in this regard, with 18% and 12% of businesses reporting present use of AI, respectively, while agriculture and construction have low AI adoption rates of 1% each.With the launch of ChatGPT, AI technologies are still at the forefront of AI market trends. After launching in November 2022, OpenAI claims that ChatGPT, its AI tool, attracted over a million users in just five days. The Head of AI & Data at Deloitte Switzerland, Marc Beierschoder, is unequivocal on the significance of AI in day-to-day business, stating that "AI is not a passing fad." In the distant past, a dazzling toy that would momentarily enhance a company's reputation for innovation has evolved into a vital instrument for smooth corporate operations. Particularly, employees are already accustomed to using generative AI technologies like ChatGPT and DALL-E, which generate fresh content in the form of text, photos, audio files, or videos.If 2023 was the year that generative AI (Gen AI) was first introduced to the world, then 2024 is the year that businesses really started utilizing this new technology and reaping its benefits. According to the McKinsey Global AI May 30, 2024 Survey, 65% of participants claimed their companies use generative artificial intelligence on a regular basis. This is almost twice as many as the survey's results from just 10 months ago. Respondents' expectations for Gen AI's impact are as high as they were last year, with three-quarters forecasting major or disruptive change in their industry in the next years.Another study by PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence, "Sizing the Prize: Exploiting the AI Revolution," examines the enormous potential that artificial intelligence holds for economies and businesses. According to the study, artificial intelligence could boost GDP in local economies by up to 26% and add an incredible $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. As businesses look to "augment" the productivity of their labor force using AI technology and automate some jobs and roles, advances in labor productivity will fuel initial GDP growth. Additionally, the analysis indicates that by 2030, improvements to products will drive up consumer demand and account for 45% of all economic gains. This is due to the fact that AI will eventually lead to a wider range of products that are more affordable, individualized, and attractive. China and North America stand to gain the most from AI, with China's GDP expected to rise by 26% and 14.5%, respectively, to reach a total of $10.7 trillion, which represents over 70% of the global economic impact.Methodology:To pick out the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024, we searched the internet for the best AI assistants in 2024 and ranked them based on their number of appearances in our sources, so each appearance got one Insider Monkey score. Then we ranked the list based on the aggregated scores.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.Apple SiriInsider Monkey Score: 11                                                 AI-powered Siri is a virtual assistant included in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s watchOS, tvOS, and iOS operating systems. It makes recommendations, executes commands, and responds to questions by using voice recognition to assign requests to online services. Siri is well known for its strong safety and easy-to-use interface.Apple is planning to replace Siri with AI to manage different application features. The concept is to use voice to control functionality within specific apps.Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”Overall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best AI assistants in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about cheapest AI stock. READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’. Disclosure: None.

Title: Google revamps controversial AI image generation tool after backlash

Test: After Google pulled the ability for its AI chatbot to generate images of people, the search giant is reintroducing the feature following a high profile backlash.Google on Wednesday said that it will start to roll out an updated image generation tool for users of the English-language version its AI chatbot, Gemini Advanced. The service will also feature Google's latest image generation model, Imagen 3.In February, Google disabled the ability of users to generate images of humans after the company acknowledged that its tool would "overcompensate" in seeking to depict diverse ranges of people, even in unrealistic or absurd scenarios. The episode highlighted the company's scramble to get in on the AI frenzy and the risks of releasing new technology without rigorous vetting.A social media firestorm drew attention to images that, for example, depicted a Black woman as a US founding father and showed Black and Asian people as Nazi-era German soldiers.Some users wielded the results as evidence of an anti-white bias in what the tool generated.The viral images sparked criticism from prominent figures, including X owner Elon Musk, who has previously criticized the perceived liberal bias of AI tools. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff at the time that some of the faulty responses were unacceptable, and that "we got it wrong.""With Imagen 3, we’ve made significant progress in providing a better user experience when generating images of people," said Dave Citron, a senior director at Google, in a blog post on Wednesday.The reintroduction is the latest development in Google's AI rollouts, which have been uneven at times.Last year, Google fumbled the release of its initial AI chatbot Bard when it spit out inaccurate responses during a promotional video.Taken together, the episodes underscored the perceived sloppiness of the launches and undermined Google's credibility just as tech giants were jostling for position amid the AI hype.Google said it has upgraded its creative image generation capabilities and will bring its latest image generation model, Imagen 3, to Gemini Apps (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)In an effort to prevent abuse, the tool won't support the generation of photorealistic scenes of identifiable individuals, minors, or excessive violence, Citron said."Of course, as with any generative AI tool, not every image Gemini creates will be perfect, but we’ll continue to listen to feedback from early users as we keep improving. We'll gradually roll this out, aiming to bring it to more users and languages soon."Google's re-release comes at a fraught moment in the AI world.In the months since the search giant originally released and pulled the tool, investors have wavered in their support of AI investments. Recent market volatility has resurfaced questions about the valuations of tech companies that have thrown enormous resources behind ambitious AI buildouts.Story continuesThe competitive landscape has also changed.While Google was previously seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft (MSFT), Apple has since joined the Big Tech AI party. And while the iPhone maker's rivals were dealing with boardroom drama and public backlash over AI developments, Wall Street has applauded Apple's efforts, highlighting the company's success at marketing AI tools in ways that other tech giants have struggled through.Google's reintroduction of the image generation feature also came just ahead of a pivotal earnings release from Nvidia (NVDA).Shares of the AI chip designer fell about 4% in after hours trading following a quarterly report that beat estimates for the top and bottom lines but failed to impress Wall Street. AI bulls saw a promising turn from Nvidia as a catalyst in what has been a challenging market for chips and AI companies.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Test: 



Apple (AAPL) closed at $228.03, within its day range. The stock has a market cap of $3.44 trillion, an average volume of 50.77 million, and a P/E ratio of 34.48. It offers a 0.44% dividend yield and trades on the NASDAQ. Analyst sentiment is generally positive, with a majority rating AAPL as a "Buy" or "Strong Buy."  Ivan Feinseth at Tigress Financial projects the strongest upside, with a price target of $295, representing a potential 30.25% increase. Other analysts, like Atif Malik at Citigroup, Erik Woodring at Morgan Stanley, and Amit Daryanani at Evercore ISI Group, also have bullish price targets ranging from $250 to $273. However, Matt Farrell at Piper Sandler remains cautious, maintaining a "Hold" rating with a $225 price target. 

Several news articles highlight Apple's involvement in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence (AI) market. One article reports on Salesforce's successful earnings, noting the company's focus on profitability and AI initiatives, with CEO Marc Benioff even mentioning the upcoming launch of "AgentForce," AI sales agents, competing directly with Microsoft. Another article focuses on Apple's new AI-powered object removal feature in its latest iOS update, showcasing the company's commitment to AI innovation. A third article compares Apple's Siri to other AI assistants, placing it fourth on a list of the best AI assistants in 2024, indicating the technology's growing popularity and potential impact on the industry.  

Despite the positive outlook, there are some concerns. One news article discusses Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake, citing the need for a "margin of safety." While this may reflect a cautious approach, the article also acknowledges the potential for AI to play a significant role in Apple's future growth. Another article notes that AI stocks, while promising, may offer greater potential for higher returns than Apple, suggesting investors might consider exploring other AI-focused companies.
